SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use IO::Socket::SecureSocks;

      my $sock = IO::Socket::SecureSocks->new(
        ProxyAddr   => 'some.ssl.socks.server',
        ProxyPort   => 1081, # default sockss port
        Username    => 'socksuser',
        Password    => 'sockspassword',

DESCRIPTION
    IO::Socket::SecureSocks connects to a SOCKS v5 proxy over a secure line
    (SSL), tells it to open a connection to a remote host/port when the
    object is created. The object you receive can be used directly as a
    socket for sending and receiving data from the remote host.
