IO::Socket::SecureSocks v0.01
==================================

This module seeks to provide a full implementation of the SOCKS5
protocol over a secure wire like a reqular socket as much as possible.

IO::Socket::SecureSocks inherits the SOCKS5 implementation from IO::Socket::Socks
and the security from IO::Socket::SSL.
